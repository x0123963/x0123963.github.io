## Welcome to my website!

My name is Chiung-Yu Chang, written as 張瓊予 in Mandarin Chinese. I also go by Lisa.  

I am a graduate student in the Department of Psychological & Brain Sciences at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. My research interests lie primarily in the **speech sounds** and **cognitive neuroscience of human languages**.  

Currently, I am working on speech perception outside typical laboratory settings, such as in background noise and under limited attention. I also hope to develop more naturalistic methods to study speech perception, capitalizing on recent advances in cognitive neuroscience.
