## Welcome to my website!

My name is Chiung-Yu Chang, written as 張瓊予 in Mandarin Chinese. I also go by Lisa.  

I am a graduate student in the Department of Psychological & Brain Sciences at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. My research interests lie primarily in the **speech sounds** and **cognitive neuroscience of human languages**. Thus, my work spans multiple disciplines, including psycho-/neurolinguistics, experimental phonetics, and laboratory phonology.
