1. Pre-attentive processing of tone sandhi in Mandarin Chinese  (PI: Prof. Jo-Fu Lotus Lin)  
  There are four lexical tones in Mandarin Chinese: a high level tone (Tone 1), a rising tone (Tone 2), a low dipping tone (Tone 3), and a falling tone (Tone 4). When an underlying tone 3 is followed by another tone 3, it surfaces as rising tone. This phonological rule is termed as tone 3 sandhi.  
  In this ERP study, we investigate **how the brain responses to the violation of the tone 3 sandhi rule**, i.e., two surface tone 3 in a row. We further ask:
  - How does **repeated exposure** to the violation influence brain responses?
  - Does **attention** play a role in the detection of violation?

2. Quantifying consonant-tone interaction in words and nonwords  (with Prof. Feng-fan Hsieh)  
  Some consonantal onsets rarely co-occur with certain lexical tones. For example, sonorant onsets (e.g., [m]) seldom appear with Tone 1. However, there are still many counterexamples to these generalizations. Thus, we proposed a measure, **tone-consonant co-occurrence probability (TCCP)**, to describe the distribution of consonantal onsets and lexical tones. 
- In our [preliminary study](https://doi.org/10.36505/ExLing-2020/11/0017/000432), we conducted a judgment experiment to see whether the new measure reflects the native speakers' **acceptability of words and nonwords**.  
- Our next step is to do a **full-scale experiment** and compare TCCP with other measures of phonotactic probability, such as the output of the Maximum Entropy Model.
