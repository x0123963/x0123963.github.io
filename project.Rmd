**ERP responses to violations of morphophonological rules, phonological expectations, and phonetic cues**  
(Advised by Profs. Lisa Sanders and Alexandra Jesse)  

The phonetic realization of the English regular plural suffix is determined by its preceding context. When the stem ends with a non-sibilant sound, the suffix and the preceding sound agrees in voicing. It surfaces as /z/ after voiced sounds (e.g., [dogz] 'dogs') and /s/ after voiceless sounds (e.g., [k√¶ts] 'cats').  

By presenting listeners with various types of violations of this morphophonological rule, this study aims to determine:  

1. the representation and processing of allomorphs during speech comprehension
2. whether congruency of phonetic cues and phonotactic status influence morphophonological processing
3. how predictability modulates other factors
