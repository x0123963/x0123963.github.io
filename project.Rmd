**Sex differences in humor styles and coping humor**  (PI: Prof. Yu-Chen Chan)    

  This study explores how sex difference relates to humor styles and coping humor, with a particular focus on **aggressive humor**. We utilize two-panel comics to contrast aggressive and non-aggressive humor. Apart from behavioral responses, we will conduct fMRI and EEG experiments to understand the roles of sex and aggression in humor appreciation at the neural level.  
  
  In collaboration with Hsinchu Mackay Memorial Hospital and National Taiwan University Hospital in Taipei, We will also recruit **patients with depression, anxiety, and autism spectrum disorder**. Our long-term goal is to develop a humor training intervention tailored to Chinese culture.
